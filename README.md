###What is POW NOW?
POW NOW is a web application that helps users pick the best ski resort for a spontaneous ski vacation by combining flight data with current snowfall at select ski resorts. 
---
###How does POW NOW work?
POW NOW assumes the user wants to fly out on a spontaneous ski vacation leaving tomorrow. The user selects their closest outbound airport and the date they would like to return. POW NOW makes an API request to World Weather Online as well as a request to Skyscanner Flight Search API and displays a list of ski resorts with their current snowfall level and flight price to get there helping the user decide where they should go ski.
